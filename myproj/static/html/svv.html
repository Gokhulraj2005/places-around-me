<h1>svv school</h1>
<p>

shri SVV matriculation higher sec.school, vandalur, chennai is where my daughter is studying from I Std., and is now in Class XII. I am now a very satisfied father in the sense that my daughter has learnt her primary education not only in acadamic but education for her life. The motto of the school is education is for life and not for living and i fully endorse their views. I feel proud that my daughter has got her education for life from wonderful teachers in the school who work on the able guidance of the principal madam who follows the teachings of Shri. Bhagawan Satya Sai Baba. Bhagwan has been their motivational force behind and they follow the advice of baba i.e. service to mankind is service to God. I am sure that this school will grow from strenght to strenght in the years to come and through their service will uplift the poor sections of our society by providing them their educational needs.I appeal to all the Ex students of this school through this message to give their helping hand by forming an alumini and to be a proud partner in their school endevours.Sai ram
