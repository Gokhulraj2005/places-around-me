KIlambakkam Bus Terminus, officially Kalaignar Centenary Bus Terminus,[1] is under construction bus terminus in Kilambakkam, Urapakkam along GST Road on the outskirts of Chennai for catering to the bus services towards the Southern districts of Tamil Nadu. Spread over an area of 88.52 acres (358,200 m2),[2] it is built to decongest the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus in Koyambedu. It will chiefly handle buses to southern Tamil Nadu, including cities such as Kanniyakumari, Madurai, Thoothukudi, Tiruchirappalli, Tirunelveli, Tiruvannamalai, Sengottai, Thanjavur and Villupuram. It is an integrated bus terminus of mofussil buses operated by TNSTC, SETC and contractual (omni) buses. It will be connected to other parts of the Chennai Metropolitan Area and suburbs by MTC buses. Once the construction is completed this one will be Asia's biggest Bus Station
